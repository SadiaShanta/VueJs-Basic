    <!-- Computed properties are used to calculate the value of a property based on some other conditions. 
    Watchers, on the other hand, are not primarily used for changing the value of a property; instead,
    they are used to notify you when the value has changed and let you perform certain actions based 
    on these changes. -->
    <!-- Computed properties are cached. This means that when you define a computed property, Vue.js will 
    calculate its value the first time it is accessed,and then it will store that value. Subsequent
    accesses to the computed property return the cached value without recalculating it, unless one 
    of its dependencies changes. -->
    <!-- when the active value will change It will It will call the setTimeout function and change the user name after 3s -->
