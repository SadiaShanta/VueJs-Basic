<!-- When the application starts, it's going to start reading from start to last,
 so at the beginning the browser is going to read gretting with the curly braces 
 we don't have Vue.js and when it's on veu js, the vue js is gouing to fire and it's 
 going to create an instance use that configuration which is in vue. And then it's
 going to check #app, and the view going back in div and copy all content and it's 
 going to reading and going to say I have a text interpolation and I have a keyword"gretting".
Do I have a keyword in my data?yes then developer wants me to replace whatever property we have right here that matches here.  -->
